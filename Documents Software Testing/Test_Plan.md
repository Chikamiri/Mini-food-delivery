# Master Test Plan - Mini Food Delivery

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Mini Food Delivery system, covering both backend (Spring Boot) and frontend (Vue.js) components.

## 2. Testing Objectives
- Ensure all business requirements are met.
- Verify system stability and reliability under various conditions.
- Prevent regressions during future development.
- Maintain high code coverage (Target: >80% for critical business logic).
- Validate security measures (Authentication, RBAC, IDOR protection).

## 3. Testing Levels

### 3.1. Unit Testing
- **Scope**: Individual classes (Services, Utils, Mappers).
- **Tooling**: JUnit 5, Mockito.
- **Focus**: Business logic, edge cases, error handling.
- **Goal**: 90% coverage for Service implementations.

### 3.2. Integration Testing
- **Scope**: Interaction between layers (Controllers, Repositories, Services).
- **Tooling**: `@SpringBootTest`, MockMvc, Testcontainers (MySQL).
- **Focus**: Database queries, JPA mappings, REST API contracts, Security filters.

### 3.3. E2E (End-to-End) Testing
- **Scope**: Full user workflows.
- **Tooling**: Cypress (Frontend).
- **Focus**: User interface, navigation, real-time updates (WebSockets), complex flows (Order to Delivery).

## 4. Testing Strategy by Domain

### 4.1. Authentication & Security
- Validate JWT generation and parsing.
- Test RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) for all restricted endpoints.
- Verify password hashing (BCrypt).
- Test Token expiration and malformed token handling.

### 4.2. Order Management
- Test the 2-phase order creation (Distance calculation fallback).
- Validate order status transitions (State Machine).
- Verify ownership checks (Prevent users from accessing others' orders).
- Test concurrent status updates (Optimistic Locking).

### 4.3. Delivery & Tracking
- Test auto-assignment generation on `OrderReadyEvent`.
- Verify shipper location updates via WebSockets.
- Test COD collection enforcement.
- Validate distance-based fee calculation.

### 4.4. Restaurant & Menu
- Test soft-delete logic for restaurants and menu items.
- Verify search functionality with various filters.
- Test promotion workflow (User -> Owner/Shipper) including Admin approval.

## 5. Environment & Infrastructure
- **CI/CD**: JaCoCo for coverage reporting, Maven for build/test execution.
- **Database**: Clean state for each integration test using `@Transactional` or manual cleanup.
- **External APIs**: Mock `MapService` (OSRM/Nominatim) in unit tests; use real or wiremocked calls in specific integration tests.

## 6. Test Data Management
- Use `BaseIntegrationTest` for common setup.
- Utilize `@BeforeEach` to populate necessary reference data (Categories, Roles).
- Use distinct test profiles (`application-test.yaml`).

## 7. Acceptance Criteria
- 100% of planned test cases pass.
- No critical or high-severity bugs open.
- Coverage targets met.
- Performance meets baseline (e.g., order creation < 500ms).
